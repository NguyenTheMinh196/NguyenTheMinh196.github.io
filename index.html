                <h2> Getting started with Git and Github </h2> 
                <p> In this page, we will be introducing to you about Git and Github which is two very important application to IT and every programmer. 
                        This program is similar to common tools such as Google Drive but it is especially built for people to work on a project or program together. 
                        Git and Github also work perfectly for people wanting to work on a coding program with helping application such as repository, pull, push and 
                        it was also supported by many coding editor for people to do their project. That is the reason why for every programmer or people who want to become
                        a programmer, learning about these application is a must. </p>

                                <p>Git is a free and open-source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It is used to manage the change to the system, which is from program, website to all kind of project that we are dealing with. When you want to start working with git, you must install git to your computer first, you can check whenever you have already had git on your computer or not by using the command git –version. If your computer does not have one, you can download it online. We recommend you using the Visual Studio Code for using Git since it supports many different programming languages and also Git</p>

                                <p>Github is the online website that contain the repository so that the other people can also join in and work with your project. It is usually used to connect between the programmer to visit other's work, work with each other</p>

                <h2>Why programmer choose Git and Github</h2>
                <p> As I mentioned above, Git and Github was perfect for hosting projects and people to work together. However, how is it better than normal application like Google Drive aside from the fact you can upload it from code editor such as Visual Studio Code? 
                The reason is because it has something called repository and branching which will be explained later on. It was made just for hosting project and user-friendly for people who are working or looking for a project.

When we are talking about coding, it is usually used to describe the project that you upload into git which is the folder that contain all the detail that makes up your project. It will be containing all the folder and coding files that made up your program.</p>

                                <h1>Creating a repository </h1>
                                <p>The first step that you should be doing after signing up for a github account is to either create a repository or import other repository. You can create one by selecting the “Create repository” button on the left (step 1). This is also the place where it will show all the repository you are currently dealing with and your teams. After pressing the Create repository button, it will lead you to this page where you are required to input information(step 2). A github repository will be looking like example when you create one and in that case, the repository that I created is called Minh196.github.io.</p>

                    <p> After finish creating your Git and Github account, you can look into setting up your computer to be ready to work with. This step can be done after you download Git and Github so in order to do so, you need to finish the install Git tutorial from above first.
                     For the next step, you will be creating a Git account that will be linked to your local machine and it will be used everytime you push something to Github. We will also look at the most basic command that you will need to know when dealing with Git</p>

                                <p>cd which is also known as change directory is one of the most important command that you also must be mindful of when dealing with. We can know where we are currently are from the first part of the code which is C:\Users\Asus in this case and when I use the code cd (a file directory), I arrived at the folder that I called (example 1). With this code, we can go to a specific folder to clone the repository online. There are 2 primary kinds of cd which is going in by using the command cd (a file directory) and going out by using cd .. command (example 2) which bring you back to file before that. It is crucial for you to know where you are so as you won’t get lost and forget where you put the project at.</p>

                                <p>Git config commands are a bunch of commands that will help you setup your git on your local machine. The two must fix when you are working with Git are creating a name and email for your local email when you are uploading to the online repository so that the other will know who upload those files and how to contact you (example). The command for that is git config –global user.name/email</p>
                            </div>

                                <h1>SSH key </h1>
                                <p>If you want the github account to understand when you are pushing some files online that It is you who are that account, you need to connect something called SSH key from your local machine to your github account. To do that, you have to generate a ssh key in your computer first by typing the command ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C (your github email address). After that, you are required to input the file’s name where it will keep the key and a password(step 1). After creating the key, if you get into the folder where you are currently at (directory), you can see there is 2 new files. One is the ssh-key’s name, and the other is ssh-key’s name pub. The file with the pub means that it is something that can be shown to the public while the other one is something you should only keep it for yourself. When you upload the file online, the program will know your private ssh-key that will lead to your public key to identify that the pusher is you not some anonymous computer. That’s why the next step is to get to github and input the ssh key to your account. To do that, you must go into setting and look for the SSH and GPG keys and click the “New SSH key” button(step 2). After clicking the button, you will be lead to a place for you to setup your key and in this case, I will be seting up mine public key by putting in the title and the content inside the file key. After finish putting in the content, you just need to add the SSH key(step 3) and then later on, when you are working with github, they will be able to know it is you by using your private ssh-key.</p>

                    <p>In this section, we will be learning about some of the most basic Git and github. Firstly, we will be learning the very first command that you need to do when you are working with git and github is git clone. 
                    After that, we can look at the other basic command for every person to work on a project. </p>

                                <p> Git clone is the most basic but also the very first command that every single person must learn when they work with Git and Github. This is a command that can be used to bring a repository that is hosted online in website such as github to a folder on our local machine. This is the folder where you can do edit to the project offline and then send it back online to make changes to your project. You can do it by pressing the green code button and click the copy code next to the link that was shown (Step 1). After that, you need to get into vsc and write the code git clone and paste the link down.(Step 2) You need to remember which folder you are currently in because the code will create a folder at the place you are currently at. </p>

                    <p> This time, we will be learning about the combination add-commit-push. This is an important combination for you to push all the file that you worked on in your local machine to the online 
                    repository. The reason why they dissect the ability to push your work online to 3 different parts is so that you can debug and fix your problem much easier. Each command in this combination has a different function that eventually, 
                    lead to you pushing your work online.<br> An important thing to notice: You have to be inside the directory so make sure that you are in the folder that you clone from the git clone command. Only by being inside the folder that you 
                    clone from github will give you the ability to use the combination.</p>

                        git pull command is for us to pull the all the changes that was made by the other to our local machine. However, unlike the combination, since the other have already fix all the bug when they use the combination when they push 
                        the changes to github, we don't need to have to go through many combination but only need to use the git pull command. <br> An important thing to notice: git pull also require you to be inside the same folder that you clone from github 
                        to be able to pull the changes in.

                    <p> Git branching is one of the most important thing and also an amazing application that made git and github become especially good for people who are working on a project together.
                     It is the ability to control the project to make sure that information can't be changes easily and should only be change when there will be no problem. That's why it become one of the best application for programmer 
                    because you can mess up the whole program just because one line of code. That's why we will be going through the basic of git branching in this tutorial and firstly, we will be learning about what is git branching and what does git branching does</p>

Branching is creating the same program and you can change it without affecting the original. With the new same program, you can add feature, fix bugs all you want and when there is no more problem, you can merge it with the master branch for it to be have all the feature that you want. This is to avoid any problem that will break your entire program just because some new lines of code that you just created. There are many different branching commands in git, but we will look at some of the most common commands.</p>

                                <p>Git branch is the command will show you all the branch that your github currently has and in this example, it only have one master branch which is the main branch. The star sign next to the master mean that we are currently inside that branch.(example)</p>

                                <p>Git checkout is used to switch between branches but when combining with -b, it will create a new branch. The full command is Git checkout -b [branch’s name] (Example). It is important for you to name the branch’s name specifically so that when the other look at it, they will also be able to understand what this file is for.</p>

                                <p>After making changes in the branch, you use the combination add and commit(example 1). The problem here will be related to the final step which is the git push command. As you know, we have only created the branch locally so online, it has yet to even has that branch to make the changes yet. That is why you are required to push all the branch to the github. The command for this is: git push -u origin (file name). This command is used to push that whole branch to Github not just some file(example 2). After pushing the branch to Github, you can merge both branch and the master branch by using the git merge command but you should only do this when you have finished all of your problems so that there won’t be any problems when merging. You can also merge online by clicking the compare and pull request on Github. It will allow you to make request for the administrator of the project to accept the merge request.(example 3)</p>

                                <p>When you finish merging and no longer needed to use the branch anymore, you can use the command git branch -d (branch name). The warning in the example is for the case when you have accidently deleted the branch when you have yet to merge so make sure to merge before you delete the branch. (example)</p>
