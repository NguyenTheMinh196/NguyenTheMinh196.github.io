            <h2>What does it do?</h2>

            <p>
              Artificial intelligent and machine learning is one of the most
              well-known branches of IT. Nowadays, there is almost no one who is
              not aware of AI industry and its growth. Most of company is
              applying AI at every place they could, and it range from
              technology company like Google to most factory using company to do
              dangerous work. Nevertheless, it is still in its growth period and
              exploding around the world. AI market is expected to grow up to
              54% in the software market

              </a>
              and 12,3% in the global market

              </a>
              in 2020 despite the COVID-19 epidemic circumstance. Moreover, this
              is when we have only reach to some certain depth of this branch.
              If we are talking about AI, it is expected that it will be having
              the ability to do the same as a human. Although we are approaching
              it and slowly getting better at making a machine that can have a
              conversation with human, for it to be able to do just like a human
              is still faraway. As AI is continuing to intervene with our lives,
              we should also learn about it and adapt to it. From smart home,
              self-driving car to face recognition at your workplace, AI is
              already becoming a part of everybody life so rejecting their
              advance is not a good decision. Moreover, it is expected that AI
              can do a much better job than human as they make less mistake,
              require no salary and can work if they are fixed regularly so it
              became a perfect work force for every company. That is why you
              should be getting used to AI and know its capability to be able to
              understand about its impact. <br />
              <br />
              For the next 3 years, AI will only grow bigger and bigger. As I
              said before, it is still in the growing phase for this branch. For
              the past years, it has made it mark in many companies as
              <a href="#" class="hover_a">

                <span class="block_hover">

              <a href="#" class="hover_a">

              </a>
              <a href="#" class="hover_a">
                and even worker.
                <span class="block_hover">
                  -Quality checker -supply chain management
                </span>
              </a>
              However, that is only the beginning for the industry as it will
              continue to grow bigger. It can be said that we are entering the
              age of AI. In 3 years, I do not think we will be able to create
              the perfect AI just yet, but we can still slowly create more AI
              application in our daily life. The problem currently with AI is
              that it is usually much more advance and usually become a package
              that goes with expensive such as self-driving car or smart home.
              For common customer service such as chatbot is easy to make and
              use. The reason for that is that it does not require much space
              and knowledge to build one for yourself. However, if we are
              talking about advance AI as the one that I said above, it requires
              complex algorithm, a lot of data and tools which made it not
              available for everyone just yet so I thought that maybe in 3
              years, the AI will be more accessible by more people.
              Nevertheless, we will still be advancing to create many better
              applications for AI but the most important is still the
              accessibility for the common people. However, for it to be a
              reality, technology must become more advance than the current
              situation. For example, for a smart home to have all application,
              you need to combine many technologies together such as
              cybersecurity, natural language processing, cloud computer and
              other application. Advancing and make the product as cheap as
              possible so that the common people can manage is the aim of every
              technology that can apply to household appliances.

            <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>

            <p>
              As the technology will become more and more advance, human life
              will also change according to it. You might not notice about how
              it is changing it every day because of its price, or it is just
              not intervening with your life just yet. However, it will soon
              begin to appear in your life from your home, your workspace to the
              road you are walking every day. Out of them, the first place where
              the changes will be is at your workplace. You might not need the
              technology nowadays or not able to afford them currently, but your
              company can, and they also want to use the AI in their industry.
              The reason for why the company wants to use AI is because they do
              not need salary, does not get tired and does the work properly.
              That is why the one who will be affected the most will be people
              working on a job that can be replaced by an AI machine. “The
              bottom 90 percent, especially the bottom 50 percent of the world
              in terms of income or education, will be badly hurt with job
              displacement”
              <a href="#" class="hover_a">

              </a>
            </p>

            <p>
              . As the quote from up there, most people who are working in
              common places such as factory will most likely will be replaced by
              AI because of their usefulness. As it progresses later, most
              repetitive will be replace since AI can learn as time went on and
              do those work much better than normal human. However, as it
              replaces many jobs in the future, many jobs will also be born
              because of it. Nevertheless, all the new jobs will require you to
              have knowledge. In other word, we are entering a time when
              knowledge is power while the work that does not require you to
              have knowledge is slowly disappearing.

            <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
            <p>
              AI has a deep influence on me since it is why I choose to follow
              the road to learn programming. Moreover, AI has already somewhat
              affected everyone lives and including me. One of the examples for
              application that use AI that has great impact is YouTube and
              Google. Have you ever wondered why once you click on a video;
              YouTube will always show you video like that one for the next few
              days? Or maybe that one time you look at the book online and after
              that, google keep on giving you advertisement about that book
              having discount or similar. That is all being done by an AI that
              is developed by their respected company. As the technology
              advance, the society will change with it. However, it will most
              likely that it will not come soon since it will take a while for,
              we will be able to reach the future where I will be greatly
              influenced by it. Furthermore, I also do not think that my parent
              job will be replaced by them in any time soon until they retired.
              However, it will affect me and my friend since we are currently
              adapting to them for the future. Many jobs in the future will be
              resolving around them so it is knowledge that we must learn about
              in order to be prepare for the future. As for my family, with AI
              program getting better and better, people lives’ quality will also
              get better so my parents might be able to have a good time as they
              retire. Did you know that AI can diagnose disease correctly up to
              87% of the cases while professional only got to diagnose correctly
              up to 86%?

              </a>
              With that in mind, I believe having an AI can help my family to
              have a better condition while resting after retired. AI in the
              future will most likely will improve everybody life and you will
              be able to see its influence everywhere you go.

              This might be one of the most simple and easy to understand branch
              out of all the branches in the technology industry. However, at
              the same time, it is one of the hardest and important one to be
              able to fully develop it. Natural Language processing and
              chatterbot is easy to build since there are many websites that
              supported such action. When using such an easy way, the most you
              will be able to build out of it is a bot that answer questions
              that has been recorded and lead a pre-recorded conversation or a
              program that can only roughly translate word by word. This
              technology is very common in the world right now. You can see its’
              presence in almost every shop or company website that you can
              think of. Even if the chatterbot or the natural language process
              of that shop is not too advanced yet, it can still help you to
              solve some of the basic problems or guide you to find the correct
              person for help. Currently, the chatterbot does not advance too
              much compare to the past since it is currently in a good condition
              where it can be used everywhere. However, the natural processing
              language is still undergoing for development since even

              , one of the famous AI developed by Amazon, sometimes fail to
              understand what you said. What you need to do now is to understand
              how these technologies work as every company should have at least
              one. This is a very good movement for all business in the world
              since it is cost-effective and useful for everyone.

            In the future, the technologies that should be cared about the most
            should be natural language processing so that it can understand you
            in most situation. The reason why it seems like a simple task is a
            demanding request because for a human, to understand or able to hear
            everything someone said is still an impossible task even if you know
            that language. The reason is because of the accent, how they
            pronounce, noise in the background, etc. That is why, in the next 3
            years, people should be focusing on natural language processing for
            it to be able to interpret our word. Moreover, they can also develop
            the technology to not only work with many different languages but
            also different accent. We can also develop it to be able to
            recognize our face no matter how far we are or how loud our
            surrounding is if they can hear us. After we managed to make
            development to natural language processing, we can look forward to
            developing chatterbot. Currently, everyone can make the simplest
            chatterbot which can answer questions that you have already setup
            from before. However, if you want to have an advance chatterbot that
            can understand what you want, you need to spend more time to create
            it. As for the future, for a chatterbot that can talk to you and
            always deliver the suitable answer to our need and to every customer
            should be the aim. Nevertheless, with the current machine learning
            development, it is something that can be achieved in 3 years. As for
            natural language processing, for the next 3 years to achieve such
            achievement is also doable. However, for a machine to record all
            language in the word is too complicated and expensive for the
            requirement of a normal human being. That is why we should be focus
            on the ability to interpret people no matter how bad their
            pronunciation is at the time. I believe that in 3 years, we will be
            able to achieve such feat with how fast technology are advancing.

            <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
            <p>
              If in the far future, there will be a device that can translate
              every language to the other, we will be able to talk to other no
              matter who they are, and it will bring people together. It will be
              a big step toward the idea of globalization that has appeared at
              least once in every child’s dream. For the chatterbot, they will
              be able to understand and answer our questions and needs much
              better than now. With the two being developed, although it sounds
              easy, but it will bring impact to the whole world. It will be
              changing the core of every human interaction which is
              communication. From every question can be answer by the chatterbot
              to the ability to talk with the translating device no matter which
              language you speak with. The people who are affected the most will
              be people dealing with language and communication in a company. It
              is true that machine might never be able to complete replace all
              the ability of people. However, most of the people can be replace
              by machine since they do a much better job than people in many
              cases. People shopping or having problem can now easily find what
              they want without much problem when chatting with the bot since
              they know everything. Moreover, people working, studying, or
              living oversea can also have no problem communicating with the
              ability to talk in every language. There will be more job related
              to maintaining and developing the device however, there will be
              some jobs that will be lost. Shopkeepers, Guide, etc. can be
              replace in the future by chatterbot and only when problem happen
              will there be needed a human. Nevertheless, this movement will
              give the world open so many chances for the future students as
              they don’t have to be worry about not be able to not being able to
              talk properly when studying oversea. There will be people who
              disagree with such movement but by all mean, this movement is a
              good thing for the world to finally reach common ground.

            <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>
            <p>
              In the far future, every person life will most likely be caught in
              the movement of these technology development if they succeed in
              making it a reality. If most people have the device to translate
              when they go oversea, the need for learning another language will
              be lessened. Nevertheless, learning it will still give us the
              ability to speak the language with emotion much better than
              machine. That does not mean that my life will be inconvenient with
              this movement because it will open so much opportunity for me.
              Furthermore, with the development of chatterbot, it will lead to
              the application of it in every single corner in the world. I will
              also need to learn about this movement to learn about the as this
              will be needed in most business not just related to programming.
              Everything that is simple in the future such as a question or
              asking about common problems will be solved by program while
              complicated things can be solved by professional. As technology
              advance, the boundary will blur but will not completely disappear
              so people life and satisfactory will grow. With the help of
              chatterbot, it will help to increase the living standard for all
              the people around me. For example, at that time, you will no
              longer needed to find the item you are looking for online but only
              need to tell the name or what you are looking for and then the bot
              will process your word and find it for you. It will help you save
              every second of your time.
