It should be able to represent all our member or suit the interest of all the members. As for me, I would want the name of the group that I work in have the name “colen”. What that group name means is that try harder. It a reminder for everyone in my team to work hard and a hope for the group that my group will always try their best to finish the assignment and bring home the best result. </p>

                    <p> The result for my learning style online is that I am a Visual and Tactile learner. This learning style is more realistic and revolve around seeing, working with what I am learning. Once I saw it or work with it, I can remember it much better than just simply knowing and understanding about it. I also often. After learning about it, I will try to form a link between all of them in my mind or just solving it in my mind until I find a solution. That does not mean I am bad at learning just by listening because my auditory stat is also around 30% which is really close to the other 2. The result is that I can learn best by seeing, touching, feeling and reminiscent about it in my head later but just listening and dreaming of all the possibilities is still possible.</p>

                    . It shows me that I am a creative, adaptive, calm, optimistic and always devote myself for the other. It is correct since it is depending on all the questions that I answered when I do the test. This test highlight that I am really devoting myself to the other and is listening to the other too much. It is somewhat true since I am always ready to take in more works to carry the team and easy sway by other opinion. Even when I am 100% sure of the answer, I can still maybe be sway if the other side is persistant enough. Moreover, I am also not too friendly to new people and it is true. I only sociable to the friends I already know but making new one by starting a conversation is closely impossible for me. Nevertheless, once the conversation start, I can say that I will</p>

                    <h2> Team profile</h2>
                    <p>After taking the personality test, I have somewhat figure out my personality and my desired teammate. The very first teammate that I really want is a leader. I am more likely to be an observer from the Myers-Brigg test, but I am not too good at leading, so I really want to have a good leader.  I can guarantee to finish my task on time and willing to help other teammates. I would also love to have the teammates who are energetic so that our group and conversation will go smoothly when we are working together. Other than that, I believe I can work just fine with every member’s personality if it is not observer since whenever they are in trouble, I am willing to help. It would be helpful if the there is somebody with the ability to dream and think of lots of new idea is good. I am a visual and tactical learner which resolve around seeing things and be able work based on that so it would be nice if there is someone to come up with ideas for the group. Having that person would make our work much better than just people follow the guideline. In conclusion, it would be nice if there are people that I mentioned above, however, even if there are not any, I will still do my best to bring home the best result. I am an adaptive, calm, and willing to devote myself so I believe I can work with everyone just fine. That is the team that I would love to have and work with for the final work and in the future project.</p>
