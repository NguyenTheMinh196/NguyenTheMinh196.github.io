                    <p class = "p_para"> The project that I want to be working on is a personal assistant AI on our computer which are like

                    . This is an AI that can listen to our demand and carry it out. However, since mine knowledge and ability are still low, creating an advance AI that can learn and be better every time I converse is impossible for now. What I can create is just the hard code for the “AI” to know exactly what I want by listening to what I said and execute the command. It is like a FAQ chatterbot, but it can do much better than just answering some questions. </p>

                    <h2> Motivation </h2>
                    <p>I have had deep passion for AI since it is what awake and promote my curiosity for IT and it is also my aim for learning IT. Moreover, the AI industry is currently a hot topic right now with everything in the world can be slowly replace by AI. Do you know that compare to last year, the global AI market in 2020 is expected grow up to nearly 54% in software market each year?

                    </a>
                    The personal AI that I want to developed is also a good start for those who are interested in learning about to get the general idea of what this all about. Moreover, it can be a good step for me to and everyone to understand the basic of a personal assistant AI.</p>

                                <p>Since I will be approaching the bare minimum of the AI like <a href = "#" class = "hover_a"> Siri<span class = "block_hover"><img src = "picture for personal website\picture_for_project_idea\siri.png" class = "image_50" ></span> </a>
                                , I will be needing it to have the ability to recognize my speech and do what I want it to do. Firstly, it must have the ability to understand my speech to it and give me back a result by talking back to me. The AI speech can also be change depend on how you prefer it to be. It might not a natural conversation, but it will be surrounding what you want to do such as “search” for a fact or look at the time. After getting the question, it will proceed to the next step which is to analyze my question and give back an answer or start using the command to answer my demand. The command I give will be vary so the AI must also have various of feature to satisfy my desire.<br> <br>
                                The second most important feature for the personal assistant is be able to answer normal question and be able to search for information from Wikipedia. When we have any question or wanting to open a web, we ask the AI for it to open that tab or answer the question with information coming from online. It will be able my question however, it will only be taking information from Wikipedia, but it is still usable for most information we require when we are asking for AI. When opening the web, most likely that I will only be able to call out for the website that I have already code for the AI to recognize because AI might misinterpret what I say and open the wrong website. <br> <br>
                                The last feature for the AI is the ability to answer some common questions that require common knowledge. If we are asking common question such as “How are you?”, “What is your name?” or “What can you do?” then the AI do not need to take any information to answer those question but only need to look through the code to answer those. The questions that need information such as asking for date, time or the weather forecast will be available. For the question asking about the date and time, the AI will be depending on the date and time of your computer to give you the answer. However, the question such as asking about the weather will require the program to run an algorithm that will return an answer to our question based on wolfram alpha language. After running it, it will give us answer to our question if it is something inside the algorithm that is doable to for the program. <br> <br>
                                The regular personal assistant bot such as 
                                <a href = "#" class = "hover_a"> Alexa<span class = "block_hover"><img src = "picture for personal website\picture_for_project_idea\alexa.jpg" class = "image_50" ></span> </a> or 
                                <a href = "#" class = "hover_a"> Siri <span class = "block_hover"><img src = "picture for personal website\picture_for_project_idea\siri.png" class = "image_50" ></span> </a>
                                can do much more than what I mentioned above, however, that might be out of scope for the current me.

                    . This is a simple task and there are many Python libraries that support this action which make Python perfect for creating a simple program like this. As for the tool for me to write code with, I am using Window operating system. As for the code editor, I will be using PyCharm

                    because it is a tool built especially for python programming. Moreover, we will be needed to be able to use a special library to turn our AI to an app that can be used.

                    <p> The first skill that you must have when you are doing this program is the ability to work with Python and have some minimum experience with it. We will also be working with many different libraries so you should be able to understand how this library work and what it does in order to do the project. However, these are not hard to learn and understand. There are many explanations online for the libraries and what you needed to do was researching and some practices to get used to it.  </h5>

                                If the project become successful, I will be able to create the first version of personal assistant AI for my personal use and for another student. This could also be a good reference for all the student who are still unclear about AI and want to learn more about it. It might not be too advance, but it is the kind that can give you the general idea of what it can do.
