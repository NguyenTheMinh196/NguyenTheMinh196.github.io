                <h2> Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do? </h2> 
                <p> Answer: In IT, first, I’m an educator teaching software engineering and IT especially things around performance, data analysis, data structure, algorithm and a range of software engineering, super testing, and software implementation. On education, I’m also do research, experiment about high-performance computing, cloud computing, distributed computing, and AI. To summary, my field of expertise is computer science across the whole range from data structure and algorithm to performance analysis, machine learning and AI. </p>

                    <h2> What is your expertise?</h2>
                    <p> Answer: The field I expertise in is Computer Science, and the industry is IT. Specifically, it is about high-performance computing

                    <h2> Is there anything you usually do outside of your expertise? </h2>
                    <p> Answer: No, the work I is pretty much about Computer Science and software engineering. If you talk about my hobby, I spend time on various things like physic and literature. In term of sport, I do not play football anymore, but I do play table tennis like ping pong. I go to gym when I can, hopefully, today, and also, I like swimming, not much lately but yeah. I do it randomly especially toward the end of the year, I had a lot of work but yeah, randomly. </p>

                    <p> Answer: Student, for sure, other academics, industry partners, people working in the IT industry, and everybody else. But mostly students and other academic, so I spent 80% of my time working with students and other academics. </p>

                    <h2> when working on a project, which expert would you work with? </h2>
                    <p> Answer: Well, when it comes to student, it is usually students who are do data science and machine learning here in RMIT, but when I am in Australia, I mostly work with other researchers and scientists especially people who do computational science. I work with people in my field which is high computational computing and other lecturers in the field computer science and software engineering. I do not work with people working with web development that much. Publishing your work to the website is just one way to deliver it. Most of the time, we deliver it through a software. Sometimes, we publish our work through web portal but now, I do not work with web people a lot. Because my work is usually high-performance computing so it is usually on cloud, on high performance computing furniture such as supercomputer or cluster and lately just a piece of software that can run on desktop.  </p>

                    <h2> where is the good place to find the problems to solve? </h2>
                    <p> Answer: For this, we must be maintaining our network. Network here could be people in the industry, people from the other institute, people from other field like in Australia, I talk to other scientist who do physic, chemistry, biomedicine, or people from other organization like hospital. I need to maintain a network like that and occasionally, we chat, we catch up, we discuss the problems and solutions and if we found out there is something in common then we tried to ask them to do something together. Normally, we do it in the form of research project, if we can get funding for that project, then we can go on and deliver some solutions. </p>

                    <h2> what aspect of your work that you usually spent most of the time on? </h2>
                    <p> Answer: In RMIT Vietnam, it is pretty much teaching. I spent most of the time to think of new problem for students to solve. I tried spending a lot of time to make sure the material that I give to the student are understandable, traceable and of course, learnable. I spent a lot of time interacting with students like you and especially students who are doing project with me. Not just capstone project but also course project and things like that as well. That spent about 70% my time here in RMIT, the rest of the time, I spent on reading research paper, get to keep myself ahead of the field. I also interact to keep my network with other. </p>

                    <h2> Can you share an example of your work to explain your work in the IT industry? </h2>
                    <p> Answer: My work in IT industry is pretty much about problem solving. I talk to people to find the problem and solve it. That is my work in a nutshell. To solve a problem, you need to know your context, have a background, and for that, you have to keep studying, learning and building your expertise, that is why me and other academics in the school keep reading not just new research paper but also new article to see what people are doing nowadays. And then we have to try to connect the dot. If I learn about a new technology for example, I want to see how it can be applied, what are the application. Once I can see how the technology can be applied, I want to see how the application are useful for certain people. After that, I can ask to publish a research project. It is important for us to not only learn about new technology but also see how we can improve such technology. When we read a research paper for example, there is some new idea in there, people have implemented some new idea. We can evaluate the idea and read that to see if I believe in this idea or technology, is it something we can do better? We have to constantly look for better solution when you can to see if you can apply the solution to something useful which is really hard. That’s my job, keep reading more, talk to more people, get to see more application, see more problems to solve and solve more problems. For example, here is a capstone project that we are doing with the students in SST. We have a lot of data on social media like Facebook, Instagram and other. Nowadays, people do not just use Facebook to share information but also to share idea and opinions. There is a big amount of opinion data about things like restaurants, shops. So, a lot of people share idea about where to find good foods, good clothes and where not to find good foods, where foods will be terrible. So, I work with student to see if we can get such data, what can we do with it. Of course, we want to get comments from users from the internet and identify where the data is useful for the business. For example, we can have a restaurant and they have some customers already, after that, they see some decline in customer. There are a lot of good comment about that place but also a lot of bad comments. If you receive the comment or look through the comment, you can find something interesting. Like last week I came, the noodle was great, but this week is terrible. After seeing that, the owner knows that they since last week, they change the cook and it seems that the cooks didn’t do that well. For small business, you can see that quite easily but for big business, you will receive hundreds of comments everyday and it will be impossible for the owner to find such comment and know about what need to be change. So, we want to build a system where we can read the comment automatically, rate them, and then find the key word automatically that point to the problem in your business then that will be very useful for your business. That is why we built the platform called social listening platform.  Social listening here meant listening to the media platform and we look through the comment from the user and then we have machine learning to rate the comment. For example, this comment here is 0 while the other is 5. After that, we can identify the negative rating one and the positive. Using the negative rating one, we want to see what can be changed. For example, there are 1000 ratings of 0-1 or 0-2 which is bad, and you can’t look through everything by yourself. That is how the machine will look at it for you like it will detect the flaws and tell you that turn out, a lot of people complain about dirty space, little space, no parking, etc. After that, you can make recommendation to the business owner through that system. You can also see the positive comment as well.  </p>
