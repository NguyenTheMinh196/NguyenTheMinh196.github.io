                <p> Your idea is really fit for the course that we are taking, however I think we could add some more feature to improve the overall project. To be honest, your project has a lot of potential, not just for yourself but the for the industry as well. This is obviously not an original idea, but it is a good step to walk into the AI world, to improve this a little bit more, you should make it online so some can see your work and add a feedback section so they can show you can update your project. </p>

                    <h2> Bui Nguyen Ngoc Tuan's feedback</h2>
                    <p>Your idea is going to be a helper to people, as to what you said, it is a personal assistant. AI is one of the most discussed topics at the moment in the IT world, and you choose to base your idea on it. This would be doable if we had the knowledge as well as the time given. As for this project, it is almost impossible for us in our freshman year to be creating the personal assistant AI without any help for the experts. Nevertheless, your idea would exceed people’s expectation if conducted successfully. </p>

                    <h2> Vo Tran Khanh Linh's feedback </h2>
                    <p> I like your idea; indeed, AI is a thing that all of us discuss about recently. We can find a lot videos online showing how to create an AI chatterbot like that, but we can do something to customize it, maybe creating a function for user to teach the bot like the user say “why it is raining today” and the robot will reply “because you have a bad day” or just fact according to the users’ wishes. Afterward, that information then will be stored in our database. Or the users can make commands not only in English but also in other languages? You could also add the ability to translate if it is possible </p>

                    <h2> Nguyen Phuong Nam's feedback</h2>
                    <p> Brilliant idea. In fact, AI assistant is always the future of IT industry and what we aim for. There are already AI software recent years such as android voice assistant, IOS Siri,etc. But overall, no one use them because of its’ engine are not smart enough.  Hopefully, your project will distinguish from the others where the AI robot can smarter and be a useful part of human’s life in the future. However, this will be a complicated program so make sure that your knowledge able to run an AI assistant. </p>

                    <h2> Reflection </h2>
                    <p> About making mine personal assistant to be online and be given feedback by people online is an obvious thing that I will do since this is not a project for myself and it can be used everywhere. Moreover, it is a personal assistant but can be change depend on where I use it. For example, if I used it on my computer, I would make it so that it will have many abilities that involve with computer, however, if I put it in something such as the number 4 in SST, only some application is needed such as chatting, greeting, face recognition while things like going to websites is not necessary. As for the ability to make such an AI, it is not much of a problem since we have yet to deal with the ability to learn of AI yet. It is true that we will not be exploring every ability of this AI just yet, but it will fit our coding experiment. It is like working on a chatterbot instead of an advance AI for now. As for customizing the bot, I am sure to be able to customize it, however, for it to give an answer depend on our mood might be troublesome. As for translation, I am sure there is a library in Python for it but I have yet to have a deeper look into it just yet. Nevertheless, it might be useful for many people if I add such feature to the AI. As for creating a distinguish project comparing to Siri and other is honestly a troublesome task to do. By all means, Siri and such are advance AI that is simple but has many uses which is why it is being trusted by big company such as Apple. However, it is not completely impossible to do such a task, but it requires time, effort, and knowledge. </p>
